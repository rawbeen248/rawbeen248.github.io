## Features
* React-Powered: Leveraging the power of React, the webpage ensures seamless navigation, efficient rendering, and an interactive user experience.
* Project Showcase: This portfolio is deliberately designed to emphasize my projects. Each project is elegantly displayed with a dedicated section, providing a comprehensive overview of its objectives, technologies used, and the link to github repository.
* Navigation Excellence: An intuitive navigation system ensures that visitors can effortlessly explore and discover my projects. A clear menu structure and smooth transitions facilitate a user-friendly journey.
* Responsive Design: The portfolio is designed to be responsive, adapting gracefully to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring an optimal experience for all visitors.
* Contact Information: While the primary focus is on the projects, I've ensured that my contact information is readily available. This makes it easy for potential collaborators, employers, or enthusiasts to get in touch.

## How to Use
Though the primary objective of this project is to showcase my other projects but if you would like to customize the templates and do for your own here are the steps to follow:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
<br/>``` git clone https://github.com/rawbeen248/rawbeen248.github.io ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
<br/>``` cd project_portfolio ```
3. Install the dependencies
<br/>``` npm install ```
4. Start the development server
<br/>``` npm start ```
5. Start the portfolio webpage by opening a web browser and naviating to 'http://localhost:3000'. Usually it should open the browser itself after starting the development server.

## Usage
Customize the portfolio by adding your own projects and tailoring the content to best represent your skills and achievements. Modify the provided template files and incorporate your project details, images, and links to external repositories or live demos.
